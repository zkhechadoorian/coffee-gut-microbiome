    "# Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis: Coffee Consumption and Gut Microbiome\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes the relationship between coffee consumption patterns and gut microbiome diversity using comprehensive alpha and beta diversity metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "- Calculate alpha diversity metrics across coffee consumption groups\n",
    "- Perform beta diversity analysis to assess community structure differences\n",
    "- Test statistical significance of diversity patterns\n",
    "- Visualize diversity relationships with coffee consumption\n",
    "- Establish baseline diversity patterns to inform differential abundance analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Hypotheses:\n",
    "1. **H1 (Primary)**: Coffee consumption is associated with specific bacterial taxa abundance \n",
    "2. **H2**: Daily coffee drinkers harbor distinct beneficial bacterial strains (ZOE-identified coffee-associated taxa)\n",
    "3. **H3**: Coffee groups show similar alpha diversity but distinct beta diversity patterns due to specific taxa shifts\n",
    "4. **H4**: Coffee's prebiotic effects support beneficial bacteria without necessarily increasing overall species richness\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Context:\n",
    "Based on ZOE research findings, coffee consumption promotes specific beneficial bacterial strains rather than broad diversity changes. This analysis will:\n",
    "- **Assess overall diversity as context** (alpha diversity likely unchanged between groups)\n",
    "- **Identify microbiome signatures** through beta diversity clustering patterns\n",
    "- **Establish baseline patterns** to inform differential abundance testing in next notebook\n",
    "- **Look for compositional shifts** rather than richness/evenness changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Strategy:\n",
    "This notebook provides the **diversity foundation** for identifying specific coffee-associated bacterial strains. We expect:\n",
    "- **Similar alpha diversity** across coffee groups (no overall richness changes)\n",
    "- **Distinct beta diversity clustering** (compositional differences due to specific taxa)\n",
    "- **Statistical validation** of community structure differences\n",
    "- **Clear setup** for differential abundance testing where coffee-specific bacterial strains will be identified\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Loading & Environment Setup**\n",
    "- Load clean datasets from notebook 02\n",
    "- Import microbiome analysis libraries (scikit-bio, etc.)\n",
    "- Configure analysis parameters and visualization settings\n",
    "- Validate data integrity and sample alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Data Preprocessing for Diversity Analysis**\n",
    "- **Sequencing depth assessment**: Evaluate need for rarefaction\n",
    "- **Feature filtering**: Remove low-abundance/low-prevalence taxa\n",
    "- **Normalization strategy**: Choose appropriate method for diversity metrics\n",
    "- **Quality control**: Final sample/feature validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Alpha Diversity Analysis**\n",
    "- **Metric calculation**: Shannon, Simpson, Observed Species, Chao1, Pielou's Evenness\n",
    "- **Group comparisons**: Coffee consumption groups (none/occasional/daily)\n",
    "- **Statistical testing**: ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis with effect sizes\n",
    "- **Visualizations**: Box plots showing (expected) similarity across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Beta Diversity Analysis**\n",
    "- **Distance metrics**: Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, Aitchison distances\n",
    "- **PCoA ordination**: Visualize community structure clustering\n",
    "- **PERMANOVA testing**: Statistical significance of group differences\n",
    "- **Dispersion analysis**: Test for group variability differences\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Integration and Interpretation**\n",
    "- **Diversity synthesis**: Combined alpha and beta diversity patterns\n",
    "- **Coffee signature validation**: Evidence for distinct microbiome compositions\n",
    "- **Effect size assessment**: Magnitude of compositional differences\n",
    "- **Foundation for differential abundance**: Clear rationale for taxa-specific analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes:\n",
    "- **Alpha diversity**: Similar richness/evenness across coffee groups (H3 support)\n",
    "- **Beta diversity**: Significant clustering by coffee consumption (H1, H2 support)\n",
    "- **Statistical validation**: PERMANOVA significance indicating compositional differences\n",
    "- **Clear biological rationale**: For proceeding to differential abundance testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis establishes whether coffee consumption creates **distinct microbiome signatures** before identifying the **specific bacterial drivers** in differential abundance analysis."
