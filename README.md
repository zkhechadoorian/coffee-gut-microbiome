# Coffee Consumption and the Gut Microbiome

This project investigates whether coffee consumption is associated with
differences in gut microbiome composition using data from the American Gut Project.

## Research Question
Do coffee drinkers exhibit differences in gut microbiome diversity or
specific bacterial taxa compared to non-coffee drinkers?

## Dataset
- American Gut Project (16S rRNA sequencing)
- Public feature tables, taxonomy, and metadata

## Project Structure
- `data/` – raw and processed data
- `notebooks/` – exploratory analysis notebooks
- `src/` – reusable analysis functions
- `results/` – figures and summary tables

## Methods (Planned)
- Data quality control
- Metadata curation (coffee consumption definition)
- Alpha and beta diversity analysis
- Differential abundance testing

## Notes
This is an exploratory, observational analysis and does not imply causation.
